✨ Personal Note
This was my first project using React combined with Tailwind CSS. Building this landing page gave me valuable hands-on experience in integrating a component-based framework with a utility-first CSS framework to create a modern, responsive, and dynamic web application. It helped me understand how to structure React components, apply Tailwind styles effectively, and enhance user experience with Framer Motion animations.
